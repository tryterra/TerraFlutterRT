# terra_flutter_rt

A new flutter plugin project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Â Using the package

The Terra Real Time package offers the capability to stream data either in your app directly using a callback function, or to your server using websockets.

Import the package in your app file:

```dart
import 'package:terra_flutter_rt/terra_flutter_rt.dart';
```

Everytime your app opens, you need to initialise the library:

```dart
await TerraFlutterRt.init(devId, "reference_id");
```

The first time ever you want to use the package, you need to register the device with Terra using `initConnection`. You can generate an SDK token from [here](https://docs.tryterra.co/reference/generate-authentication-token) using your Terra dev credentatials:

```dart
await TerraFlutterRt.initConnection(sdktoken);
```

The packages support streaming from the following wearable types:

```dart
enum Connection { ble, apple, wearOs, android, ant }
```

and supports streaming the following data types:

```dart
enum DataType {
  heartRate,
  ecg,
  steps,
  hrv,
  calories,
  location,
  speed,
  distance,
  stepsCadence,
  floorsClimbed,
  gyroscope,
  acceleration
}
```

An example using a connection and a set of data to be streamed:

```dart
const connection = Connection.ble;
const datatypes = [DataType.heartRate];
```

For BLE connections, you can pull a BLE scanning UI for the user to select a device:

```dart
if (connection == Connection.ble || connection == Connection.wearOs) {
    await TerraFlutterRt.startBluetoothScan(connection);
}
```

The same applies to ANT devices:
```dart
if (connection == Connection.ant) {
    await TerraFlutterRt.startAntPlusScan();
}
```

With the device and dataypes set, you can now start streaming. To stream locally in your app directly, you can pass a callback function that will get triggered with the data:

```dart
void dataCallback(String data) {
  print(data);
}

// .......
await TerraFlutterRt.startRealtimeToApp(connection, datatypes, dataCallback);
```

Example payloads:

```json
{"val":86,"type":"HEART_RATE","ts":"2022-10-24T09:15:25Z"}

{"d":[1.373291015625E-4,-3.96728515625E-4,-1.068115234375E-4],"ts":"2022-10-24T09:20:27.985Z","type":"GYROSCOPE"}
```

To stream to your server using Websockets, you need a websocket token generated from [here](https://docs.tryterra.co/reference/generate-user-token):

```dart
await TerraFlutterRt.startRealtimeToServer(connection, datatypes, websockettoken);
```

Example payloads:

```json
{"op":5,"d":{"ts":"2022-10-24T09:18:27.729Z","val":83.0},"uid":"66fbb25f-e1d2-44d1-bc4d-6b4844bd0928","seq":16073,"t":"HEART_RATE"}

{"op":5,"d":{"d":[0.0049285888671875,-3.662109375E-4,-2.899169921875E-4],"ts":"2022-10-24T09:19:06.328Z"},"uid":"66fbb25f-e1d2-44d1-bc4d-6b4844bd0928","seq":16088,"t":"GYROSCOPE"}
```

Finally, you can stop streaming and disconnect the device on command:

```dart
await TerraFlutterRt.stopRealtime(connection);
await TerraFlutterRt.disconnect(connection);
```
